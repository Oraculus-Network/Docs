# Design Goals

#### Zero Tolerance for Data Leakage:

* Ensuring strict measures against unauthorized data access or leakage.
* Advanced encryption and access controls maintain data privacy within smart contracts.

\


#### Upholding Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:

* Guaranteeing data security through confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
* Robust cryptographic techniques and redundancy mechanisms ensure data accuracy and accessibility.

\


#### Ecosystem Optimization:

* Optimizing the entire web3 ecosystem for efficiency and cost-effectiveness.
* Integration with Chainlink oracles and IPFS enhances functionality while minimizing costs and latency.

\


#### End-to-End Trustless:

* Establishing a trustless environment for transparent and autonomous smart contract operation.
* Leveraging trusted execution environments and blockchain technology for tamper-proof execution.
